# Random Forest Classifier

For the random forest classifier I made 15 feature classes which were then
used to train a random forest classifier. That classifier was then pickled
into 'optimized_model.pkl'. This file needs to be in the same directory
as the jupyter notebook to run the validation function. The validation
function, run_final_classifier(), outputs the filenames and predicted
classes as 'validation_predictions.txt'
