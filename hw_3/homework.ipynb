    "# 1) Monty: The Python Siri\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make a Siri-like program (call it Monty!) with the following properties:\n",
    "   - record your voice command\n",
    "   - use a webservice to parse that sound file into text\n",
    "   - based on what the text, take three different types of actions:\n",
    "       - send an email to yourself\n",
    "       - do some math\n",
    "       - tell a joke\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, if you say \"Monty: email me with subject hello and body goodbye\", it will email you with the appropriate subject and body. If you say \"Monty: tell me a joke\" then it will go to the web and find a joke and print it for you. If you say, \"Monty: calculate two times three\" it should response with printing the number 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: you can use speed-to-text apps like Houndify (or, e.g., Google Speech https://cloud.google.com/speech/) to return the text (but not do the actions). You'll need to sign up for a free API and then follow documentation instructions for using the service within Python. "

    "# Question 1\n",
    "My strategy for this question is to use the audio recording script Prof. Bloom showed in class. Send this to a houndify to parse, this portion was written mostly using the documentation provided by houndify. Taking the output text from houndify is put into a list format after determining the type of request. This part of the script is essentially a decision tree that leads to the last step that either a) uses stmp to send an email or b) does the math, or finally c) uses beautifulsoup to go to a website and get jokes\n",
    "\n",
    "The math portion can take in directions in several ways:\n",
    "    addition can either be directed as \"number plus number\" or \"add number and number\"\n",
    "    subtraction can be \"number minus number\" or \"subtract number from number\"\n",
    "    multiplication can be \"number times number\" or \"multiply number and number\"\n",
    "    division is given as \"number divided by number\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The email segment requires the following verbal format:\n",
    "    \"email me subject FILL IN and body FILL IN\"\n",
    "    As long as you say email before any other command including joke, add, times etc. the program will email you and \n",
    "    not follow the later command\n",
    "    \n",
    "The joke segment only requires that you say \"joke\" and do not activate any of the other functionalities \n",

The sound files use 32 bit data. Play around with what happens when you convert the string data to other integer sizes, or signed vs unsigned integers. Also, beware of harmonics."
